# WIT-ACT

The Frontend and Backend folders each contain their own README and `package.json` files. 

To use this project, 
1. Configure a MySQL database named WIT_ACT. Create tables using the `.sql` files in `/Backend`.
2. Please install all dependencies from each end (`npm i` in both `/Frontend/wit-act-app` and `/Backend`)
3. Start both servers - `npm start`.

The Frontend is hosted at [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000), and the Backend is hosted at https://localhost:3100. Please do not navigate to the backend, as it has no visual elements and only serves as an API for the frontend.
